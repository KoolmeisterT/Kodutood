Instructions
Nr 1. Compare two arrays.
Write a method which takes two integer arrays of the same length. Method should return an array of integers which values are result of comparison of input arrays using the following rules:
•	a[i] > b[i], then 1
•	a[i] == b[i], then 0
•	a[i] < b[i], then -1
Possible method signature:
static int[] CompareArrays(int[] a, int[] b) { ... }
 
Sample input:
a = [1, 3, 9]
b = [-2, 6, 9]
 
Expected output:
[1, -1, 0]
 
Hints: 
Use for loop to iterate both input arrays and assign values to output arrays.

Nr 2. Diagonal difference.
Write a method that will sum matrix diagonal values and then calculate absolute difference. 
 
Possible method signature:
static int DiagonalDifference(int[,] matrix) { ... }
 
Sample input:
1, 2, 3
4, 5, 6
9, 8, 9
 
Expected output:
2
 
Explanation:
First diagonal: 1 + 5 + 9 = 15
Second diagonal: 3 + 5 + 9 = 17
|15 - 17| = 2
 
Hints:
Use two-dimensional array for storing matrix. Write down indexes that you need to sum diagonal values and then create a for loop that will generate the needed indexes.
Use Math class for finding absolute difference.

Nr 3. Staircase.
Write a method that prints a staircase of size n. The staircase is right-aligned, composed of # symbols and spaces, and has a height and width of n.
 
Possible method signature:
static void Staircase(int n) { ... }
 
Sample input:
5
 
Expected output (each row must have 5 chars (space or #)):
        #
      ##

Nr 4. Plus minus.
Write a method that takes an array of integers and prints the fractions of its elements that are positive, negative, and are zeros.
 
Possible method signature:
static void PlusMinus(int[] arr) { ... }
 
Sample input:
[-1, 3, -9, 5, 0]
 
Expected output:
Positive: 0.4
Negative: 0.4
Zero: 0.2
