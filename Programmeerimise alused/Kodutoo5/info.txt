Star Wars API
 
Create a console app that will allow to search Star Wars characters and will display in how many films they appeared.
 
Use Star Wars Open API: https://swapi.co/
For characters search use the following URL: https://swapi.co/api/people/?search=TODO (replace TODO with search term).
Try to call this API and check the response structure. Create appropriate classes so you will be able to deserialize API JSON.
 
Example 1:
Please enter character name:
> luke
Luke Skywalker appeared in 5 films
 
Example 2:
Please enter character name:
> lu
Luke Skywalker appeared in 5 films
Luminara Unduli appeared in 2 films
