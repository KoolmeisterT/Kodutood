1.	Create integer variable which value is your year of birth (1999, 2001 etc).
2.	Create two-dimensional array of integers where each dimension is of size 4.
3.	Fill the array with random numbers 0 <= n <= 400
4.	Calculate the sum of border/outer values.
5.	Check if sum of border values is equal to your birth year.
6.	If not then go to 3 and repeat until values are equal.
7.	Print how many iterations it took to have the same values.
 
Here is some info about two-dimensional arrays:

Example of calculating border/outer values for two-dimensional array of size 3:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
 
1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 4 = 40
